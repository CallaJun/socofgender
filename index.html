					<h1>Bingo as a Gendered Activity</h1>
					<h3></h3>
					<p>
						<small> by Calla Carter</small>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>What is a gendered activity?</h3>
					<p>An gendered activity is one that is associated with a specific gender because of its
					social or structural rules or the genders of its participants.</p>
					<p>An activity becomes gendered once it is socially related to one gender
					over another. The gender association of an activity is a social construction.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Positive Aging Lower Merion</h3>
					<!--I went to PALM-->
					<p><i>"To assist adults, 55 years of age and older, to maintain a healthy, satisfying quality of life by providing services and activities in a nurturing environment that enables them to function more independently in the community."</i></p>
				</section>
				<!--First, just in case you ever go to PALM and play Bingo, I should tell you the rules - there are four rules.-->
				<section>
					<h3>Bingo @ PALM</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>No talking during Bingo.</li><!--Pretty self explanatory-->
							<li>No repeats or clarifications.</li><!--So if I call B12 and you don't remember whether or not I called B12, that's just your loss-->
							<li>Across/Diagonal --> T/X/Square --> Full board</li><!--Draw it out. Emphasize that we will not stray from this-->
							<li>Be nice to the volunteer.</li><!--Bingo at PALM depends on volunteers - be nice!-->
						</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Androcentrism</h2>
				</section>
				<!--I lied. There's actually a fifth rule.-->
				<section>
					<h2>5. No boys allowed!</h2>
				</section>
				<!--Let's look at the makeup of the Bingo players at PALM-->
				<section>
					<h3>Who played?</h3>
					<p>Women.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Bingo, Hegemonic Masculinity, and the Gender Transgression Zone</h3>
						<ul>
							<!--Bingo did not align with the men's internalized ideas of hegemonic masculinity because it was predominantly played by women. In fact, when Bingo first began, Betty claimed that men did play it. But it slowly transformed into a women's activity-->
							<li>Men moved away from the Bingo table cluster</li><!--Men physically moved away from the Bingo table cluster. They would sit on the outliers and read, talk quietly sometimes, play cards occasionally.-->
							<li>Men grew defensive when accused of playing Bingo</li><!--When one men remained at a Bingo cluster table, a woman asked, "Are you playing?" and he almost jumped away from the table and said, "Oh no, I'm not" defensively. The other men chuckled. The man sat by himself. That man had crossed the gender transgression zone.-->
							<li>Only man allowed to play was "David," who had severe Dementia - he was not a hegemonic man</li>
						</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Women and Bingo</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Rules of Bingo were strictly enforced.</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>No talking during Bingo. - <b>"Shhh!!!"</b></li>
						<li>No repeats or clarifications. - <b>Snapping</b></li>
						<li>Across/Diagonal --> T/X/Square --> Full board - <b>Yelling, arguing</b></li>
						<li>Be nice to the volunteer. - <b>Admonishing</b></li>
						<!--This ties into the stereotypes of women being caddy and fighting with each other.A women's sport at PALM meant that the women were competitive with each other.-->
					</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Value of Bingo for Women</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>"It keeps my mind sharp."</li>
						<li>Who can handle the most cards?</li><!--Women valued who had the most cards - "Oh, she has 6 cards!" Status symbol.-->
						<li>Disappointment when Bingo was not held</li><!--They would leave, be very upset, disappointed. Lost, depressed-->
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>So what does this tell us about women at PALM?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Many have lost their principle roles as wives and mothers</li>
						<!--Husbands dead, children grown up-->
						<li>For many, PALM is only source of engagement</li>
						<!--Carmen - for some people here, this is their only meal.-->
						<li>Bingo is stimulating, something to look forward to</li>
						<!--One woman: I've been practicing all week (Keeping track of 7 cards)-->
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>So what does this tell us about women?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Women's assumed values and priorities are their families</li>
						<li>Lives are centered around "expressive" values over "instrumental" values like careers</li>
						<li>Many "face to face" friendships gone, void is far more devastating to women than men's loss of "side by side" friendships</li>
						<!--While women are socialized to value face to face friendships, intimate confidants, men are taught to value side by side friendships, with whom they can share activities. Because women's core values are expressive over instrumental, friendships are more deeply central to women's values, and they feel much more empty without. This isn't to say that men are not devastated when a friend dies or moves away. But men are not socialized to value friendships in the same way, and for the same reasons. For women, because of "expressive" values, friendships are necessary to their "nurturing" identities.-->
